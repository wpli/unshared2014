(4) Certain back-to-back arrangements.--If the taxpayer is also     a service recipient and maintains one or more nonqualified deferred     compensation arrangements for its service providers under which any     amount is attributable to services performed on or before December     31, 2008, the guidance issued under paragraph (4) shall permit such     arrangements to be amended to conform the dates of distribution     under such arrangement to the date amounts are required to be     included in the income of such taxpayer under this subsection.        (5) Accelerated payment not treated as material modification.--    Any amendment to a nonqualified deferred compensation arrangement     made pursuant to paragraph (4) or (5) shall not be treated as a     material modification of the arrangement for purposes of section     409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(6) Accelerated payment not treated as material         modification.--Any amendment to a nonqualified deferred         compensation arrangement made pursuant to paragraph (4) or (5)         shall not be treated as a material modification of the         arrangement for purposes of section 409A of the Internal         Revenue Code of 1986."

(2) Application to existing deferrals.--In the case of any         amount deferred to which the amendments made by this section do         not apply solely by reason of the fact that the amount is         attributable to services performed before January 1, 2009, to         the extent such amount is not includible in gross income in a         taxable year beginning before 2018, such amounts shall be         includible in gross income in the later of--                    (A) the last taxable year beginning before 2018, or                    (B) the taxable year in which there is no                 substantial risk of forfeiture of the rights to such                 compensation (determined in the same manner as                 determined for purposes of section 457A of the Internal                 Revenue Code of 1986, as added by this section).            (3) Accelerated payments.--No later than 120 days after the         date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall issue         guidance providing a limited period of time during which a         nonqualified deferred compensation arrangement attributable to         services performed on or before December 31, 2008, may, without         violating the requirements of section 409A(a) of the Internal         Revenue Code of 1986, be amended to conform the date of         distribution to the date the amounts are required to be         included in income.            (4) Certain back-to-back arrangements.--If the taxpayer is         also a service recipient and maintains one or more nonqualified         deferred compensation arrangements for its service providers         under which any amount is attributable to services performed on         or before December 31, 2008, the guidance issued under         paragraph (4) shall permit such arrangements to be amended to         conform the dates of distribution under such arrangement to the         date amounts are required to be included in the income of such         taxpayer under this subsection.
